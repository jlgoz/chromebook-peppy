chromebook-peppy
================

stuff related to the google chromebook (acer c702)

mostly shamelessly ripped from elsewhere but where i've written something it will have my deets.

I used Xubuntu 14.4.1 32bit only thing that doesn't seem to work for me is the trackpad. Instead of getting drivers to work I use a corded USB mouse anyway. That works better than using the trackpad.

This version of Xubuntu runs very well on this machine.
